# Hot

* [oklab](https://github.com/alltom/oklab): Oklab color space for Go’s image.Color
  * Very simple. Very practical.
* VNC experiments: [vncfreethumb](https://github.com/alltom/vncfreethumb), [dirgui](https://github.com/alltom/dirgui), [vncrps](https://github.com/alltom/vncrps)
  * Who needs a GUI toolkit? Start a VNC server in your app. The base protocol is very simple. Here are some examples.
* [todournament](https://github.com/alltom/todournament): sort lists by becoming the comparator yourself
  * Sort lists as much or as little as you want using pairwise comparisons
  * It’s like a pro version of humansort.com (also mine)
* [ckv](https://github.com/alltom/ckv): audio(/visual??) programming language based on Lua, inspired by ChucK
  * The web site was amazing… I’d like to bring it back one day
    * [It’s archived, at least.](https://web.archive.org/web/20161026201955/http://ckvlang.org/) Look at that gosh darned tutorial. Look at that gosh darned language reference!

# Warm (deep cuts)

* [tomcalendar](https://github.com/alltom/tomcalendar): command-line reminder scheduler
  * Keep a text file of reminders and date specs (specific dates, days of the month, every N days, etc) → run tomcalendar to print today’s reminders
* [rc](https://github.com/alltom/rc): fork of rakitzis’s rc shell
  * Adds support for .rcrc-nonlogin, a startup file that will be executed in every instance of the shell
  * Adds instructions for how to compile it with readline support
* [debugview](https://github.com/alltom/debugview): printf debugging gets tables, bar charts, and arbitrary HTML
* [propagators](https://github.com/alltom/propagators): a fraction of an implementation of an execution model inspired by a mental image Radul and Sussman had of CPUs being ordered by the bushel
* [need](https://github.com/alltom/need): a cache where the work to satisfy simultaneous misses for the same key is delegated to just one of the requestors

# Lukewarm (once were hot, now might be rot)

* [coolterm](https://github.com/alltom/coolterm): minimal shell based on the macOS rich text widget
  * The whole thing is editable, so you can delete stuff, bold stuff, etc, as you work
  * If you’ve used Plan 9’s shell, you known what I mean—but this is rich text
* [esprima-selector](https://github.com/alltom/esprima-selector): CSS selectors for esprima AST nodes
* [falafel-helpers](https://github.com/alltom/falafel-helpers): simpler methods for injecting code into falafel ASTs: wrap/before/after
* [node-addc](https://github.com/alltom/node-addc): AddC online clustering algorithm in Node
* [room](https://github.com/alltom/room): Ruby DSL for text-based “adventures”
* [ruck](https://github.com/alltom/ruck): precursor to ckv, a library for cooperatively scheduled threads with a shared virtual timeline
  * [ruck-realtime](https://github.com/alltom/ruck-realtime): wall clock time
  * [ruck-midi](https://github.com/alltom/ruck-midi): MIDI clock time (outputs a MIDI file)
  * [ruck-ugen](https://github.com/alltom/ruck-ugen): audio file time (outputs an audio file)
  * [ruck-glapp](https://github.com/alltom/ruck-glapp): OpenGL frames
* [easyget](https://github.com/alltom/easyget): command-line precursor to AirDrop
